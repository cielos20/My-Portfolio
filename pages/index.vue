          <h2>I'm Rodrigo</h2>
          <p>
            I have 2+ years of experience with programming in general, mostly with web stuff. I'm particulary fond of the back-end but I don't shy away from the front-end. My prefered language is JavaScript, but I also know Python, SQL, PHP and C++.
            <br>I'm fond of challenges and new technologies, so I like to try new stuff all the time, which allows me to broad my view towards other languages, frameworks and libraries and most importantly learn to adapt to new tasks.
            <br>I'm also experienced in using image editors like Photoshop and Ilustrator and UI/UX software like Adobe XD and Figma.
            <br>As far has hobbies go I like to play videogames mostly rpgs and mmos like WoW and FFXIV and read japanese comic books whose number I read is too large for me to count or even estimate. I also like try new kinds of experience in my personal life, mostly food related, but I also love to travel and find more about other cultures and their yummy dishes.
